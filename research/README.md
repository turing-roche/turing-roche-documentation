# Turing-Roche Partnership Research

Due to the broad nature of our North Star (*'To enable the generation of insights to better understand patient and disease heterogeneity and its relevance to clinical outcomes at an unprecedented level of precision in order to improve clinical care'*), the partnership has decided to focus on three research themes across the 5 years. You can find more information about activities under each of our research themes on our [webpage](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/alan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership).

The scientific objectives for the multimodal are still being determined! In the meantime, initial investigations will focus on the [TCGA database](multimodal-learning/tcga-overview-and-reading.md).
