# Code of Conduct and Turing-Roche Slack Workspace Policy

The Turing-Roche Partnership is committed to creating and working in a mutually respectful, collaborative and inclusive environment. 
We value the involvement of everyone in our community and will ensure all our activities have opportunities for everyone to contribute their 
voices and different perspectives, particularly as we bring together academic and industry organisations.

We ask anyone engaging with the Turing-Roche Partnership to conform to the following:

### Expected Behaviours
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Bring your open, collaborative self- collaboration is at the heart of this partnership and we’re keen for people to make new connections 
* Be mindful and considerate of others participation- do not interrupt others or monopolise the conversation- we want everyone to feel confident to contribute their voice, especially if they are less used to doing this
* Do not harass people

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include offensive communication or violent threats directed against another person (e.g relating to gender, race, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance or religion), 
publication of private communication without consent, unwelcome sexual attention, 
inappropriate physical contact or continuing to initiate interactions with someone after being asked to stop.

### Consequences of unacceptable behaviour
People who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. 
This applies to all Turing-Roche events and platforms, either online or in-person. 
If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, any member of the Turing-Roche core team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or asking them to leave the event or platform. 

### Turing-Roche Seminar Series, Workshops and other events
In addition to this code of conduct, all attendees to our events are also expected to adhere to the [Turing Events Code of Conduct](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/policies-and-guidelines). 

### Contact information
If you would like to report an incident or have any concerns at any time you may contact the Vicky Hellon, Community Manager for the partnership at vhellon@turing.ac.uk or Project Manager for the partnership Michelle O’Gorman at michelle.ogorman@roche.com. 

Alternatively, if you would like to contact someone outside of the core partnership team, please contact Alden Conner by email at aconner@turing.ac.uk

# Turing-Roche Slack Workspace Policy
The Turing-Roche Partnership uses Slack for collaborative conversations across the Turing and Roche networks and beyond. 
It is open to anyone interested in joining.

We want our Slack Workspace to be a space for social and informal discussions such as highlighting interesting papers, asking questions in the research area of patient/treatment heterogeneity or wider data science/AI areas, offering advice and perspectives or sharing events and opportunities.
Please communicate appropriately and use the contact information above if you see anything inappropriate. 
**Do not use the Slack Workspace to share any sensitive information or data.**

If you are new to the Slack Workspace we’d encourage you to introduce yourself in the #introductions channel. Anyone is welcome to start conversations- a good starting point may be the #general channel- if there is sufficient interest you’re welcome to set up a new channel (we suggest you make it open so anyone can join it) or Vicky can help you do this. 
For conversations in the #general channel we suggest you respond in the ‘thread’, to minimise any confusion between conversations.

Whilst you are using Slack, you must be aware that it is a US-owned company and thus all data and conversation is "owned" in the US data centre outside UK law. 
It is a closed community social media channel but, while it has a robust security policy, like most cloud services, the Turing-Roche partnership would not be able to claim compensation for any security breaches, and it may close down taking all its messages with it.
It may also be bought by another company who will have access to its data. The full terms of service for Slack can be found on their website: https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/terms-of-service.
