# Turing-Roche Community Scholars Conference Attendance 

The Turing-Roche partnership sponsors Community Scholars to attend one conference during their cohort year. Scholars will then produce a post conference output (such as a video, blog, report) about their time there. If you are attending one of the conferences below and would like to engage with one of our scholars then please feel free to message them through the [Turing-Roche Slack Workspace](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSep6mcxlA-QouGk1HLuonmnn-Ml6aEyhClbYOSPW4UEr6OALA/viewform) to arrange this.
