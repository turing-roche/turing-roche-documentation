# Community Scholar Project: Risks of Bias Chapter 
## Jack Breen

### Overview of planned project
'Risks of Bias' in research are opportunities for reported results to become distorted by limitations within the study design, conduct, and analysis. Many risks can be mitigated, though this requires researchers to be aware both of the risks and the mitigation techniques. In our chapter of The Turing Way handbook, we will provide guidance on performing more reliable and reproducible research. 

### Milestones

#### Quarter 1 (September, October, November)
- [ ] Familiarise with TTW
- [ ] Read previously identified resources
- [ ] Create chapter outline

#### Quarter 2 (December, January, February)
- [ ] Share outline with community
- [ ] Look for collaborators
- [ ] Gain further insights from community (questionnaire/interviews?)

#### Quarter 3 (March, April, May)
- [ ] Finish first full draft
- [ ] Attend Book Dash in May 

#### Quarter 4 (June, July, August)
- [ ] Integrate changes from community feedback
- [ ] Document any unfinished/unscoped areas of interest


### How the community can connect with the project
This project would benefit greatly from community involvement, either in writing parts of the chapter, or by sharing experiences/opinions/resources. Please email me at scjjb@leeds.ac.uk. 


### Any other notes
My background is in mathematics and statistics, and more recently in biomedical computer vision. I was inspired to create this chapter when I conducted a [systematic literature review](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41698-023-00432-6) and found significant issues with all of the previous research in my field according to [PROBAST](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30596875/).
