# Community Scholar Project: Data Missingness Turing Way Chapter
## Zeena Shawa

### Overview of planned project
Missing data is a common occurrence in modern data science, especially with the increasing availability of large, multimodal datasets. However, missing data or entries with missing data are often removed from any analysis. Thus, this project aims to create a chapter in the Turing-Way to provide an overview of missing data and potential techniques to handle it. 

### Milestones

#### Quarter 1 (September, October, November)
- [ ] Complete Chapter Outline
- [ ] Discuss ideas with Turing-Roche experts

#### Quarter 2 (December, January, February)
- [ ] Complete First Draft of Chapter
- [ ] Share and seek out feedback from Community

#### Quarter 3 (March, April, May)
- [ ] Finalise Chapter, taking in feedback
- [ ] Organise Supplementary Activity ( e.g. demystifying video/ knowledge share session/ workshop)
- [ ] Attending Turing Way May Book Dash

#### Quarter 4 (June, July, August)
- [ ] Hosting/Completing Secondary Smaller Activity 
- [ ] Conference and Reflections


### How the community can connect with the project
I aim to make major updates of this project public, as this project would greatly benefit from any collaboration and feedback. Please also feel free to contact me at: zeena.shawa.20@ucl.ac.uk. 

### Any other notes
As in-depth textbook-like resources on Data Missingness already exist, the aim of my project is to create an easy-to-follow chapter for Data Scientists who are unfamiliar with Data Missingness and want to find out what they can do about missing data in their projects. My background is in Biomedical Engineering and Medical Imaging, and therefore I have also had to look into Data Missingness from this point of view.
