# Turing-Roche Knowledge Share Events

The Turing-Roche Knowledge Share Series has been running since April 2022. 

These virtual events bring together members of both Roche and Turing's networks, as well as the wider scientific community, to showcase partnership updates and research, knowledge share and hear different academic and industry perspectives on data science topics to help build new connections. 

You can find upcoming events [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/turing-roche-knowledge-share-series) and details of past events below.
