Launched in June 2021, the Turing-Roche Partnership is a 5 year collaboration aiming to develop new data science methods to investigate large, complex, clinical and healthcare datasets to better understand how and why patients respond differently to treatment, and how treatment can be improved.

Our newsletter features what's new in the partnership and opportunities, events and news from both the Alan Turing Institute, Roche and wider relevant networks.

If you have anything you'd like featured in a future newsletter then please get in touch with Vicky Hellon, Community Manager for the partnership at <vhellon@turing.ac.uk>

### New podcast on data science in healthcare from our Community Scholars

As part of our Turing-Roche Community Scholar Scheme two of our scholars, Florence Townend and Davy Tennison, have created a podcast 'Data Day Health' which explores the intersection of AI, med-tech, and data science in healthcare. 

The series will discus different areas where data, medicine, and AI intersect: surgery, hospital care, apps, wearables, and finally their own PhD research projects.

The first two episodes of Data Day Health cover smart watches and AI in hospitals respectively, and are out now on [Spotify](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-gbr.mkt.dynamics.com%2Fapi%2Forgs%2Fcd69a60c-3e6e-41d1-9cc4-5dc606fed704%2Fr%2F-tlsGv9l4kG1ifu4imiiJwEAAAA%3Ftarget%3D%257B%2522TargetUrl%2522%253A%2522https%25253A%25252F%25252Fopen.spotify.com%25252Fshow%25252F2YrjZTXoSAOHFsuQtjgR3z%25253Fsi%25253D762702a406d6414f%2522%252C%2522RedirectOptions%2522%253A%257B%25225%2522%253Anull%252C%25221%2522%253Anull%257D%257D%26digest%3DOJZOJbO680t18XAr6yLme7UjiTpIuM6ZXl1nFZAgJcM%253D%26secretVersion%3Da6751a3a834744298598bfc7d73b336f&data=05%7C02%7Cvhellon%40turing.ac.uk%7Ce7ea6ee74bbd47527a9708dcc83888aa%7C4395f4a7e4554f958a9f1fbaef6384f9%7C0%7C0%7C638605392408529205%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=HX7EM%2FAk%2B%2BGVGj3RNFGdKxDR%2F5r940MpjRQIl%2Brb6Gk%3D&reserved=0) and [Apple Podcasts](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-gbr.mkt.dynamics.com%2Fapi%2Forgs%2Fcd69a60c-3e6e-41d1-9cc4-5dc606fed704%2Fr%2F-tlsGv9l4kG1ifu4imiiJwIAAAA%3Ftarget%3D%257B%2522TargetUrl%2522%253A%2522https%25253A%25252F%25252Fpodcasts.apple.com%25252Fgb%25252Fpodcast%25252Fdata-day-health%25252Fid1760541849%2522%252C%2522RedirectOptions%2522%253A%257B%25225%2522%253Anull%252C%25221%2522%253Anull%257D%257D%26digest%3DwkOVe3r4c%252Fm52t5Zu2YdGIQg1XQTQ5J3czARzNf0agM%253D%26secretVersion%3Da6751a3a834744298598bfc7d73b336f&data=05%7C02%7Cvhellon%40turing.ac.uk%7Ce7ea6ee74bbd47527a9708dcc83888aa%7C4395f4a7e4554f958a9f1fbaef6384f9%7C0%7C0%7C638605392408535063%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=8LDn93KJBSi9CdGsmLqPLlcztWA%2Fj9C6Fms3jV%2BhIq8%3D&reserved=0).

### New publication on Computational Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions for Drug Repurposing from our partnership Theme Lead Tapabrata (Rohan) Chakraborty

Our Theme Lead Rohan has published a new paper from his independent research. 'Computational analysis of pathogen-host interactome for fast and low-risk in-silico drug repurposing in emerging viral threats like Mpox' was published in Scientific Reports and introduces a computational method to predict pathogen-host interactions, helping to understand the molecular processes involved in viral infection and to aid in the development of repurposed drugs for emerging infectious diseases such as, but not limited to, Mpox.

### Showcasing the impact of Professor Jean Golding's work in population health in Bristol and beyond

**11 September 2024**

This hybrid event will take place in Bristol and online and is celebrating Professor Jean Golding OBE's 85th birthday by showcasing the legacy of her work creating and deriving insights from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), known as 'Children of the 90s', more than 30 years ago.

The event will also highlight current and future opportunities for researchers interested in working in population health, epidemiology and data science applied to health research.

### 1st International Workshop on Responsible AI for Healthcare and Net Zero (Hybrid)

**16-17 October 2024**

The University of Hull and IIT Madras are jointly organising the 1st International Workshop on Responsible AI for Healthcare and Net Zero.

Responsible AI efforts so far have been criticised to be 'western focussed' and ignoring the unique context of developing and under-developed countries. This workshop will uniquely explore these imbalances by bringing researchers, practitioners and policymakers from around the world to discuss Responsible AI frameworks, present cutting-edge research in this growing research area and advance the understanding and implementation of Responsible AI in the fields of Healthcare and Net Zero.

### Cold Spring Harbor Meeting on Biological Data Science

**Talk abstract submission deadline:**

**23 August 2024**

**Poster submission deadline:**

**01 October 2024**

**Event: 13-16 November 2024**

The sixth Cold Spring Harbor meeting on Biological Data Science will take place in November 2024. The scope of this meeting will be the infrastructure, software, and algorithms needed to analyse large data sets in biological research. 

Abstracts are welcome from researchers in both academia and industry who work on technical aspects of the discussion topics in all areas of biology, from genomics to imaging. Abstracts are also welcome from translational and clinical researchers who regularly mine large data sets as part of their projects. 

The goal is to assemble a multidisciplinary audience that will discuss best practices, identify challenges, and highlight successes in the analysis of large biological data sets.

### Counterfactual Fairness for Small Subgroups

August's publication of the month is the preprint 'Counterfactual fairness for small subgroups' from researchers based at the University of Minnesota, related to our partnership research theme of predictive modelling. 

The authors look at the problem of quantifying fairness with small subgroups and take a three-pronged approach to address this, including a counterfactual fairness framework and incorporating external data.
