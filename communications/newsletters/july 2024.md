Launched in June 2021, the Turing-Roche Partnership is a 5 year collaboration aiming to develop new data science methods to investigate large, complex, clinical and healthcare datasets to better understand how and why patients respond differently to treatment, and how treatment can be improved.

Our newsletter features what's new in the partnership and opportunities, events and news from both the Alan Turing Institute, Roche and wider relevant networks.

**Featured Community Scholar of the Month**
-------------------------------------------

In September 2023 we welcomed our first cohort of Turing-Roche Community Scholars: 10 UK PhD students who are joining the partnership for 12 months to develop community-based projects for the partnership, alongside their ongoing PhD studies. Each month we are featuring a different scholar in our newsletter.

You can find out more about our community scholars [here](https://public-gbr.mkt.dynamics.com/api/orgs/cd69a60c-3e6e-41d1-9cc4-5dc606fed704/r/PUWi09U-B0WPUgII8g6fZyQAAAA?target=%7B%22TargetUrl%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fwww.turing.ac.uk%252Fresearch%252Fresearch-projects%252Falan-turing-institute-roche-strategic-partnership%252Fcommunity-scholars%22%2C%22RedirectOptions%22%3A%7B%221%22%3Anull%7D%7D&digest=t2LJ%2FcuUKf%2BbPX6MzfylUvwyOpTh%2FiVSFyWMpkumTeM%3D&secretVersion=a6751a3a834744298598bfc7d73b336f).

This month's scholar is Syafiq Ramlee, from University of Cambridge.

### **Tell us a little bit about yourself and your current research**

###

Hi. I'm Syafiq, a final-year PhD student based in the Department of Radiology at the University of Cambridge. I have a keen interest in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging because it uniquely lets us see the biological processes happening in our body. My PhD work involves getting more information out of these images through radiomics, the process of turning medical images into meaningful data. I'm specifically researching how tumour radiomic features from PET scans respond to changes in imaging parameters, while also looking at ways to improve the stability of their responses. This is important because for radiomic features to have any real applications in the clinic, such as predicting cancer patient outcomes, we need to be sure that they can be reliable across different imaging scenarios.

### **What is your community scholar project? Why is this of interest to you?**

I'm creating an animated video series called #ExplainToMe, which spotlights the Turing-Roche partnership's three research themes in an accessible manner. Two out of three episodes are now available on the partnership's YouTube channel, which you can watch [here](https://public-gbr.mkt.dynamics.com/api/orgs/cd69a60c-3e6e-41d1-9cc4-5dc606fed704/r/PUWi09U-B0WPUgII8g6fZyYAAAA?target=%7B%22TargetUrl%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fplaylist%253Flist%253DPLDbZND-EA4eE5i6jg2wP5qImCjuWoFx91%22%2C%22RedirectOptions%22%3A%7B%225%22%3Anull%2C%221%22%3Anull%7D%7D&digest=t2%2FSUQayWtzanCeh0Wh0Zlhv1GklQhTVsXKtvI8RH3o%3D&secretVersion=a6751a3a834744298598bfc7d73b336f). This project is particularly meaningful to me because I do a lot of graphic design work outside of my studies and wanted to incorporate that passion into my PhD. This video series has been the perfect way to do that. Episode 3 coming soon!

### **What is your favourite movie, book, or TV show?**
Severance is my all-time favourite TV show. A beautifully crafted series with a gripping science fiction story. If you've watched it, and don't agree with me, we might have a problem....

### **No time to die: An in-depth analysis of James Bond's exposure to infectious agents**

This month's selected publication is [this paper](https://public-gbr.mkt.dynamics.com/api/orgs/cd69a60c-3e6e-41d1-9cc4-5dc606fed704/r/PUWi09U-B0WPUgII8g6fZycAAAA?target=%7B%22TargetUrl%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Fwww.sciencedirect.com%252Fscience%252Farticle%252Fpii%252FS1477893921002167%22%2C%22RedirectOptions%22%3A%7B%225%22%3Anull%2C%221%22%3Anull%7D%7D&digest=6P4ZDTYenrNqPWGe9CrwDMamVlZcxgR%2FKGX4eDNYL14%3D&secretVersion=a6751a3a834744298598bfc7d73b336f), chosen by our featured Community Scholar Syafiq Ramlee.

'If anyone fancies a light and humorous read over the summer, this paper is the one. While this peer-reviewed study mainly explores James Bond's inconsistent adherence to international travel advice, it also offers an interesting summary of the various health risks we should be aware of when travelling. Worth a read!'
