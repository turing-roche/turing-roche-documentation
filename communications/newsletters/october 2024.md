Launched in June 2021, the Turing-Roche Partnership is a 5 year collaboration aiming to develop new data science methods to investigate large, complex, clinical and healthcare datasets to better understand how and why patients respond differently to treatment, and how treatment can be improved.

Our newsletter features what's new in the partnership and opportunities, events and news from both the Alan Turing Institute, Roche and wider relevant networks.

### New Partnership Publication 'Deep Learning as Ricci Flow'

Our partnership team members Anthony Baptista, Alessandro Barp, Tapabrata (Rohan) Chakraborty, Chris Harbron, Ben MacArthur have published the paper 'Deep Learning as Ricci Flow' in Scientific Reports.

Our team present a computational framework to quantify the geometric changes that occur as data passes through successive layers of a deep neural network. This framework can be used to create a 'global Ricci network flow' that can assess a deep neural network's ability to disentangle complex data geometries to solve classification problems. Anthony and Chris have also written an accompanying blog post about the paper which you can read below.

The partnership team recently attended Roche's Innovation Day at their UK site in Welwyn Garden City on 24 September. The aim of the day was to explore how to build more strong networks within Roche and showcase how they work with partners to develop solutions to big questions within healthcare.

Research Associates Fiona Young, Ariane Marandon-Carlhian and Ioanna Thoma (left to right in photo above) presented posters on their research from our Multimodal Analysis and Predictive Modelling themes. Partnership Lead Chris Harbron and Senior Research Community Manager Vicky Hellon also gave a talk on the partnership's research and community activities, alongside a talk on AI in healthcare from Nick Fuggle, organiser of [Turing's Clinical AI Interest Group](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic-gbr.mkt.dynamics.com%2Fapi%2Forgs%2Fcd69a60c-3e6e-41d1-9cc4-5dc606fed704%2Fr%2F32OWP5AaVEeMUiTEEMRDDw0AAAA%3Ftarget%3D%257B%2522TargetUrl%2522%253A%2522https%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.turing.ac.uk%25252Fresearch%25252Finterest-groups%25252Fclinical-ai%2522%252C%2522RedirectOptions%2522%253A%257B%25221%2522%253Anull%257D%257D%26digest%3DkrGvqGWenfUtLWlNkK18TZJVxeSEAAhYzVTstxTO5Kg%253D%26secretVersion%3Da6751a3a834744298598bfc7d73b336f&data=05%7C02%7Cvhellon%40turing.ac.uk%7C4d693f36055b40096b6a08dced31e3a8%7C4395f4a7e4554f958a9f1fbaef6384f9%7C0%7C0%7C638646045760498534%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=rvs2WiiRMQn%2Bi%2B42bXst4YEj1KH53ZBLOk5jnUqiDTI%3D&reserved=0).

### New publication on AI Content Detection from our partnership Theme Lead Tapabrata (Rohan) Chakraborty

Our Theme Lead Rohan has published a new paper from his independent research. 'AI content detection in the emerging information ecosystem: new obligations for media and tech companies' was published in Ethics and Information Technology and discusses new obligations for providers of AI content generators, broader regulation and how this content relates to 'free expression'.

### Posterior Conformal Prediction

October's publication of the month is the arXiv preprint 'Posterior Conformal Prediction'.Â 

This paper is relevant to the partnership's Predictive Modelling research theme, particularly the work of Research Associate Ariane Marandon-Carlhian who is using this technique.

The authors, from Stanford University, introduce a new method of posterior conformal prediction which generates prediction intervals with both marginal and approximate conditional validity for clusters (or subgroups) naturally discovered in the data. This technique is then evaluated on diverse datasets from socio-economic, scientific and healthcare applications.
